A utility modlist for TES3 - Morrowind; your ultimate guide to getting started in the wonderful world of modding.

This list is set up as a guide, but is easily installable using the [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org) tool. I recommend going through the guide at least once, as it holds valuable lessons you will need along your journey. The Wabbajack install is intended for users who know what they are doing and want to get straight to modding. Skip to the Wabbajack section of the read me to install the list via Wabbajack.

### Assumptions

This guide makes the following assumptions for your modding journey:

1. **You plan on installing several hundred mods.** Many of these steps set you up for success for when your modlist becomes large and unweildy. If you don't plan on installing an ungodly amount of mods, you may not get the most out of MMEFT, but it certainly won't hurt.
2. **You plan on sharing your modlist on Wabbajack.** Making lists for Wabbajack, even just for sharing with a friend, requires special set up. If you don't want to use Wabbajack, there are several steps you may be able to skip.
3. **You have tried modding Morrowind at least once.** Some knowledge is accepted as common and may not be explained. If you run into any terminology or instructions you don't recognize, feel free to ask for help.

## Resources

Here are a list of reading material, communities, and other guides you may find useful along your journey.
#### Communities
- [RingComics' Discord](https://discord.gg/6wusMF6) - This is my personal Discord, where I host discussion and support for my various projects, including MMEFT. MMEFT has it's own channel and is eligible for the `#support` channel.
- [Morrowind Modding Community Discord](https://discord.gg//morrowindmoddingcommunity) - The central hub for all things Morrowind modding. If you have a question about Morrowind, there's a place to ask here.
- [Wabbajack Discord]() - News, support, and information regarding the Wabbajack tool. Great resource for people wanting to make their own Wabbajack list.

#### Sites
- [Danae's blog](https://danaeplays.thenet.sk/) - Danae is a very active and talented member of the Morrowind modding community, and regularly posts useful, interesting, and thorough articles on her blog about Morrowind modding.
- [Morrowind Modding Hall](https://mw.moddinghall.com/) - MMH is a modding forum specifically for Morrowind, run by STiX. Here you can find discussion threads, mod downloads, community events, and more!
- [Nexus Mods]() - Nexus Mods has become the main repository for Morrowind Mods. Most of your mods will likely be sourced from here, especially if you want to make a Wabbajack list.
- [Morrowind Modding History]() and [Great House Fliggerty]() - These used to be the main spot for mods and discussion for the community, and many great mods can still be found here. These sites are prone to going down, and therefore unfortunately unsupported by Wabbajack.

#### Guides
- [Morrowind# by Sigourn](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp) - Morrowind# (pronounced *sharp* is a highly compatible, highly stable, vanilla-friendly game focused on enhanced gameplay and a vanilla+ aesthetic. 
- [Morrowind Graphics Guide by DassiD](https://wiki.nexusmods.com/index.php/Morrowind_graphics_guide) - Previously known as the S.T.E.P. guide, the Morrowind Graphics Guide (MGG for short) is all about improving the game's visuals while still maintainting the vanilla game's aesthetics.
- [Morrowind 2020: Thastus Edition](https://github.com/Tyler799/Morrowind-2020/blob/master/Morrowind_2020.md) - This is an updated, revised and re-written version of Cynderal's guide (Morrowind 2017), which was an updated version of Guideanon's 2016 guide, which is apparently a revised version of the Morrowind 2015 guide.
- [Morrowind Immersive Overhaul by /u/MorrowindNostalgia](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19n-4coZka9hcvzaufWSuv-SVbwHplXyhCE7BAhuzxUA/edit) - With Morrowind Immersive Overhaul, the goal was to create a simple and elegant overhaul that retains the feel of vanilla Morrowind, while still offering a variety of fresh features that breathe new life into the game world. 
- [An Alternative to Morrowind Rebirth by RandomPal](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48812) - This guide's purpose is to provide a relatively small list of mods that when used together will replace what Morrowind Rebirth has to offer and with a result that's - in my opinion - superior.
